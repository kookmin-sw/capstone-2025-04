# Algorithm Problem Templates

This directory contains template code files used by the problem generator to create algorithm problems.

## Directory Structure

Templates are organized by algorithm type in subdirectories:

```
templates/
├── 구현/
├── 그래프/
├── 다이나믹 프로그래밍/
├── 그리디/
├── 이분 탐색/
├── 너비 우선 탐색/
├── 깊이 우선 탐색/
├── 최단 경로/
├── 정렬/
└── 자료구조/
```

## Template Format

Each template should be a Python (.py) or C++ (.cpp) file that demonstrates the algorithm.
Include detailed comments explaining the algorithm and implementation details.

## Adding New Templates

To add a new template:

1. Place it in the appropriate algorithm type directory
2. Make sure it's well-commented and follows best practices
3. Test it with the problem generator

The problem generator will use these templates as a base for generating new programming problems.
