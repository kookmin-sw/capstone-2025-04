Return a JSON with the following structure:
- "goal": A one-line summary of the core logic that the problem is trying to solve.
- "key_constraints": Array of strings describing key input/output constraints.
- "concepts": Array of strings listing algorithms or data structures keywords (e.g., Greedy, Sorting, Prefix Sum).
- "input_schema_description": A clear description of the expected input object/structure and the types of its components. Be specific about property names, data types, ranges, and meanings. For example: "Input is an object with keys: nodes (int), edges (list of lists [u, v, w]), source (int)".

For example:
{{
  "goal": "Find the longest increasing subsequence in an array",
  "key_constraints": ["Input is an array of integers", "Output is a single integer"],
  "concepts": ["Dynamic Programming", "Array", "Subsequence"],
  "input_schema_description": "Input is an object with a single key 'nums' containing an array of integers."
}}
